Introduction
---------------------
This is the README.txt associated with Nicole Howard's submission for the Supervised Learning assignment. After reading this file, you should where to find my code and how to run it. Happy reading! 


Requirements for Running Code 
---------------------
The code was developed using Python 3.9.6 in a jupyter notebook. Installation of the packages needed to run the code can be found commented out at the beginning of the notebook. After package installation, you should be able to run the code from beginning to end without error.
